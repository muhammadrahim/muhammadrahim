### Hi there 👋

I worked with Kotlin for almost 2 years as a Backend Engineer @ N26. I hold two degrees: Maths & Computer Science. In my CS Thesis, I proved new theorems in the field of runtime complexity for a type of AI known as evolutionary algorithms.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end through React & TypeScript, and how to do deployments from scratch without using the cloud.
